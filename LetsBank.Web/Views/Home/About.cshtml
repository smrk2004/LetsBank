<pre>
Please code a solution that can perform the following workflows through a console application 
(accessed via the command line) as well as through a web page. They don’t have to run at the
same time, but if you would like to do that, feel free!

-Create a new account
-Login
-Record a deposit
-Record a withdrawal
-Check balance
-See transaction history
-Log out

Please use a temporary memory store (local cache) instead of creating an actual database.

C# is preferred but not required. Use whatever frameworks/libraries you wish, and just make
sure they are included or available via NuGet/npm/etc. Please don't spend much time on the UI
(unless you love doing that).
